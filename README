To re-run all analyses and plots:
a. download vectors from online sources and normalize by l2 norm (links in paper)
b. set up parameters to run as in run_params.csv
c. run changes_over_time.py
d. run create_final_plots_all.py 


dataset_utilities/ contains various helper scripts to preprocess files and create word vectors. From a corpus, for example LDC95T21-North-American-News, that contains many text files (each containing an article) from a given year, first run create_yrly_datasets.py to create a single text file per year (with only valid words). Then, run pipeline.py on each of these files to create vectors, potentially combining multiple years into a single training set. normalize_vectors.py contains utilities to standardize the vectors.
